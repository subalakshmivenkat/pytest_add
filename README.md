# DATE: 25/10/2024
# REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040162
# Aim:
To write a python program for addition of two numbers and test the test cases using Pytest.
# Algorithm:
Step 1: Write the python program for addition of two numbers. 
Step 2: Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
Step 3: Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”. 
Step 4: Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is saved and type “pytest test_add.py” and run it. Step 5: Stop the program.
# Program:
```
def add(a,b): 
return a+b 
def test_3_plus_5_equals_8(): 
assert add(3,5) == 8 
def test_2_plus_3_equals_5(): 
assert add(2,3) == 6
```
# Output

# Result:
Thus, the python program for addition is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
